# Utah Teachers Project One

Today we are going to create a simple web page that has some information about yourself. Follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, take a look at the index.html file for direction.

* Open your text editor and create a new file called `index.html`
* Set up the basic scaffolding for an HTML document
* Create an `h1` tag that contains your name.
* Create three separate `div` tags with this information inside: address, phone and email
* Create a paragraph about yourself using the `p` tag.
* Create a list with bullet points that contains three of your favorite hobbies.
* Create a smaller heading that says "Movies"
* Create a list with 1,2,3 rather than bullets and list your favorite movies
* Create a new paragraph that talks about your three favorite movies
* Create an even smaller heading that says "What I Look Like"
* Create a paragraph that talks a little more about yourself
* Insert an image of yourself
